# 📧 Spam Message Classifier (First ML Project)

This is my **first self-project in machine learning**, where I built a spam message classifier using Python and Scikit-learn.

The model predicts whether an SMS message is **spam or not spam** using text classification.

## 📂 Files Included

- `spam_predictor.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook with all the steps
- `spam.csv` – Dataset used (labelled SMS messages)

---

## 📌 Project Highlights

- Cleaned and preprocessed real-world SMS text data
- Converted text into numerical form using **TF-IDF Vectorizer**
- Trained and evaluated two machine learning models:
  - ✅ Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - ✅ Logistic Regression
- Achieved **97% accuracy** with Logistic Regression

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TfidfVectorizer
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🎯 What I Learned

- How to process and clean text data
- How to build classification models for NLP
- How to evaluate model accuracy and performance

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

This is a beginner project. In future, I plan to:
- Add deep learning models
- Handle imbalanced data
- Improve evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score
